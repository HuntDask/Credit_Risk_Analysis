# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
In this project, we are using machine learning to build models and algorithms to determine credit risk for a loan company. Our machine learning building will lead to more accurate identificaton of good loans for applicants. We are assisting the lead data scientist to help build and develop machine learning models to help determine the right candiates for credit application. We evalute the performance of our clients through models created to predict how well they are suited to apply for a loan with our company.
